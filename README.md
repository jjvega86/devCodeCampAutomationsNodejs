# devCodeCampAutomationsNodejs

Converting existing Python based client to a Nodejs SDK with plans to integrate with Pipedream's API connection service for serverless trigger based workflows and scheduled actions
Eventually splitting into a microservice based architecture with hopes to run on a cloud platform independently

NOTES:

- Using ES6 modules (this is set by adding the "type" property to package.json and setting the value to "module")
